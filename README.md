## 📌 Overview
This project implements fundamental Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using Python, without relying on high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn for model building.
The goal is to understand the mathematical foundations and internal working of core ML algorithms.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- PCA
